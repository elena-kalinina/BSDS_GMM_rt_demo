# BSDS_GMM_rt_demo

This is a demo showing a simulation of how incremental learning of a GMM in real time works with real-time neuroimaging data (fMRI). The screen output demonstrates motion correction, image acquisition and real-time clustering that "switches on and off" when receiving a simulated input from the stimulation computer. The data is just a mean volume coming from several scans of several subjects and is there for illustrative purposes, to create a demonstration similar to a real-time setting. 

How to use the demo:

1. Download the code and the data
2. Change the paths in the rtfmri_session_BSDS_DEMO file.
3. Run the rtfmri_session_BSDS_DEMO file cell by cell.
